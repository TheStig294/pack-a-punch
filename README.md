**A very unique buyable item for TTT!**

On purchase, the current weapon you are holding gets upgraded!
These are hand-crafted unique upgrades for over 150 different weapons available on the Gmod workshop.

Most are much more than a stats upgrade, and may drastically mix up how the weapon works, or add some goofy or fun new features!
Even if a weapon doesn't have a unique upgrade, basic weapons are given a random stats upgrade instead!

# Example Upgrades

Crowbar: Double swing speed and minimal push cooldown\
Harpoon: Throw 3 harpoons in a fan!\
Magneto-stick: Picks up players instead!\
Incendiary grenade: Spawned fire is permanent\
Detective ball: Turns into a Pokeball! (That can catch and release players!)\
Holstered: Upgrades yourself!

# Settings/Options

**Use the in-game F1 menu tab to adjust this mod's settings**
There you will find a list of all the weapon upgrades in the game, and the ability to enable/disable any of them, and adjust an upgrade's individual settings if it has any. This menu of course is only available to admins!\
\
\
Alternatively, if you know what you're doing, add the below convars to your server's *server.cfg* or *listenserver.cfg* for peer-to-peer hosted games:\
\
*ttt_pap_apply_generic_upgrades* - Default: 1 - Weapons without upgrades will *try* to be upgraded with a random "generic" upgrade (Normally a stats upgrade)\
\
*ttt_pap_detective* - Default: 1 - Detectives can buy PaP (Requires map change)\
\
*ttt_pap_traitor* - Default: 1 - Traitors can buy PaP (Requires map change)
