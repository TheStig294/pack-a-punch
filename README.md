# "Pack-a-Punch" item for Garry's Mod TTT

This is a buyable shop item for Gmod TTT available to basically every role with a shop.\
\
On purchase, the current weapon you are holding gets upgraded! There is support for over 150 different weapons available on the Gmod workshop!\
Most are much more than a stats upgrade, and may change how the weapon works entirely.\
\
Even if a weapon is not supported, floor weapons are given a "generic" stats upgrade if no unique upgrade is available. (By default) Any weapon that uses SWEP.Primary stats like TTT Base or TFA Base should work.
