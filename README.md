# "Pack-a-Punch" item for Garry's Mod TTT

This is a buyable shop item for Gmod TTT available to basically every role with a shop.\
\
On purchase, the current weapon you are holding gets upgraded! There is support for over 150 different weapons available on the Gmod workshop!\
Most are much more than a stats upgrade, and may change how the weapon works entirely.\
\
Even if a weapon is not supported, floor weapons are given a "generic" stats upgrade if no unique upgrade is available. (By default) Any weapon that uses SWEP.Primary stats like TTT Base or TFA Base should work.

# Settings/Options

_Words in italics_ are console commands.\
Press ` or ~ in a game of TTT to open the console and type in _the words in italics_ (plus a space and a number) to change this mod’s settings. \
\
Alternatively, add the italic text to your __server.cfg__ (for dedicated servers)\
or __listenserver.cfg__ (for peer-to-peer servers)\
\
For example, to turn off floor weapons being given "generic" stat upgrades, type in:\
_ttt_pap_apply_generic_upgrades 0_\
(1 = on, 0 = off)\
\
_ttt_pap_apply_generic_upgrades_ - Default: 1 - Weapons without upgrades will _try_ to be upgraded with a random "generic" upgrade (Normally a stats upgrade)\
_ttt_pap_detective_ - Default: 1 - Detectives can buy PaP (Requires map change)\
_ttt_pap_traitor_ - Default: 1 - Traitors can buy PaP (Requires map change)\
\
__For settings to enable/disable any one upgrade, or change their settings, see the in-game F1 menu tab!__\
__(Available only to admins)__
